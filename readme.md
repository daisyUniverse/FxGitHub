# FxGithub
An attempt to make discord embeds of github snippets a little nicer

# HOW TO USE:
1. Go to the page of a file you'd like to share some code of
2. Shift+Click what the first line-number of snipped you'd like to share is
3. Shift+Click the last line-number of the snippet you'd like to share
4. In your url bar you should have a link ending in, for example, #L1-L51
5. Copy this url, paste it into discord
6. Change github.com to fxgithub.com and change that last # to a ?
7. Paste
8. Image Get!!

This server uses `carbon-now-cli` in order to create a pretty, syntax-highlighted preview image of your desired code

There is still much work to be done! For example, I have yet to support sending the entire file without the L arguments, and I have not yet implemented a way to parse specific characters (this shows up as C arguments in the URL, and won't work)

This is just a for-fun project, and I do not hold myself liable to keep this up and running forever


**This project DOES save all code passed through it, and images generated. If you don't like that, don't use it.**
